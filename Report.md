**Videogames sales and ratings analysis**

This report accounts for the videogames sales and ratings in North America, Europe, Japan and other areas (grouped together) from the 1980 until 2016. The dataset does not include PC videogames sales.  

GRAPH 1 reports the total videogames sales per geographic area as a function of the year. The total sales remain constant during the first 15 years. From 2000 until 2016 the sales data follow a Gaussian curve, where there is a drastic increase of sales especially in North America and Europe until around 2008/2009, followed by a steep decrease.

GRAPH 2 shows the global sales trend of the 6 publishers with the highest sales during the period 1980-2016. *Nintendo* is the publisher with highest sales with around 1800 million of games sold, followed by *Electronic Arts* with just over 1000 million of videogames sold. *Activision*, *Sony Computer Entertainment* and *Ubisoft* follow in 3rd, 4th and 5th position respectively.

The trend of the global sales per publisher as a function of the year (grouped in 5 years) is shown in GRAPH 3. *Nintendo* has always been the publisher with the highest sales except in the five years that goes from 2000 to 2005 where *Electronic Arts* sold slightly more games.

As it is possible to see from GRAPH 4 the game with more sales is *Wii Sport* which doubled the sales of the second game *Super Mario Bros*. The other games follow at close distance from each other. The very high sales of *Wii Sport* might be due to the inclusion of the game together with the console (Nintendo Wii).

GRAPH 5 shows the 6 games with highest sales both as total and partial (per geographical region) games sales. Most of *Wii Sport* sales come from North America followed by Europe. North America has an important role in the sales of *Super Mario Bros* and *Tetris* with almost 75% of the total sales. Japan contributes for almost a third of the *Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue* sales.

GRAPH 6 shows the consoles that sold more videogames (years 1980-2016) grouped by geographic area. XBOX 360 (*X360*) was the console that sold more videogames in North America, followed very closely by *PS2* and *Nintendo Wii*. In *Japan* the three consoles with highest games sales were *DS* (1st), *PS* (2nd) and *PS2* (3rd) whereas in Europe *PS2*, *PS3* and *XBOX 360* were placed 1st, 2nd and 3rd respectively. Three considerations are worth to notice. First is that *PS2* is the only console being present in the first three positions in all the three geographic areas. Secondly, it is surprising that although *XBOX 360* is positioned 1st in North America and 3rd in Europe, it is not present in the 10 consoles with highest videogames sales in Japan. Last but not least is that the 10 consoles with highest sales in Japan are all of them Japanese consoles.

GRAPH 7 shows the videogames sales grouped by genre in the three geographic areas. *Sport* games are the most sold in both Europe and North America whereas in Japan are not very popular. An opposite result is showed by *role-playing* games. These are the most popular in Japan but not very popular in the other 2 geographic regions. *Platform* showed also high sales especially in Japan and North America (2nd most sold genre in both geographic areas).

*Puzzle* games were very popular in the years 1985-1990 but the sales dropped in the next 5 years. These increased again to reach the original value of 50 million of copies sold. Despite *Puzzle* games increased the sales, their increment was less markable than the competitors: *Miscellaneous*, *Simulation* and *Fighting*. Remarkable is the trend shown by *Miscellaneous* games that had an incredible boost in sales. These passed form around 10 million in 1985-1990 to over 300 million in about 20 years.   


GRAPH 9 shows the correlation between *Critic score* and *User score* grouped per games genre. The value of coefficient of determination R^2 (0.2) demonstrate a low correlation in between the two scores. In particular users tend to give higher scores (round marker) than critics (triangle marker). Critics gave a higher score only in *Sports* games, 4 where the genres with comparable score (*Miscellaneous*, *Shooter*, *Racing* and *Strategy*) and users gave a higher score in the remaining 7 genres. In particular, *Role-Playing* was the genre with the highest user score and *Sports* where the genre with the highest critic score. *Miscellaneous* and *Adventures* received respectively the lowest user and critic score.

The size of each marker is proportional with the total number of games released per genre. *Action*, *Sports* and *Shooter* where the genres with more games published whereas *Puzzle* had the lowest level of publication.
